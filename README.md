README

Description: We will be creating a text-based version of Minecraft. Minecraft is a procedurally (randomly) generated 3D game where players can obtain resources, craft them, and build structures. There is also an ending where players can reach and defeat the “final boss” of the game, a dragon in a dimension called “the end”. 

What would the final product look like?
The final product would be a text-based version of minecraft with significantly reduced functionality and gameplay. 
	
What functionality will it have?
The player will be able to test out SOME features that currently exist in minecraft.

What is the target demographic?
	Young children and pre-teens, although the game will still try to appeal to adults.

What are some similar products in the field? How might they be an inspiration? What would be different from their product?
Seeing as we are coding “the back end of minecraft”, a similar product would probably be minecraft. What sets us apart from minecraft is the fact that our game is text based and significantly worse. 
	
Development plans
Which flavor(s) of agile will you use?
Kanban 
How will you demonstrate this?
ICS4U system implementation kanban board
By utilizing a Kanban board to plan for, organize, and document the creation and implementation of features into our program. 
The order in which tasks are to be completed is listed top to bottom for each person
		
How will you ensure everyone has equal responsibility for their parts?
Using the Kanban board, we have designated roughly equivalent tasks for each person. Of course, we will help each other when needed,
	
How are your initial plans for the sprints?
We will be creating a general outline and assigning roles and goals for the whole team. 
Sprint 1: Create the player class, implement a basic inventory system, add the bare minimum in items, and create a bare-bones overworld for the player to move around in. 
Sprint 2: Add more items (such as armor and weapons) into the game, implement mining (caves) and crafting into the game. Add environmental features into the overworld (such as deserts, villages, jungles). 
Sprint 3: Complete the nether and end dimensions, allowing the player to “beat” the game. If there is time, add optional features such as potions and weapon enchantments


How are you going to test if your program is working?
Rigorously test each component to ensure the system has no flaws or bugs. Maybe get other group members to check over work to ensure that something does not slip through the cracks. Otherwise, testing, testing, testing and PCR test.
